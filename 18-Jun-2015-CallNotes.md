# Call Notes - 18 June 2015

Bill, Nick, and Ian had a call of about an hour on 18 June 2015.

We had a good chat about the project. Updates included work on Compute Canada cluster and work on documenting warcbase implementations (<https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki>). 

## Proposed Next Steps
- Exploring purchase of a server at York University Libraries
    + can be hosted in Library data center
    + Can go through library purchasing and explore discounts
    + That allows us to use the York machine as a production one; the Canada Compute one as an experimental one
        * With ample SSD, shouldn't need to worry about memory as limiting factor on Solr instance
- Ian will generate user accounts on the Compute Canada system
    + *Domain* is needed: perhaps via <namecheap.ca>? 
- Talking about possibilities re: *Mathematica*, esp. around image recognition and deep-learning things; new release may have even more notable things.
- We also talked about potential hires and individuals who might be interested in working.

We'll have another call in late August 2015.
